The :mod:`gp` sub-package contains a genetic programming framework that produces
Push programs.

The genetic program framework is heavily inspired by the
`Scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_ machine learning framework. PyshGP is
designed to be usable using only the base classes, many of which are sklearn
estimators. The PyshGP genetic programming framework aims to be easily embedded
into Data Science/Machine Learning pipelines, over being used as a standalone
tool.

Aside from the general goal of Inductive Program Synthesis, the PyshGP
genetic programming framework does not have a single intended application (ie.
regression, classification, etc).
