Push Genetic Programming in Python. For the most complete documentation,
refer to the [pyshgp ReadTheDocs](http://pysh2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Push Genetic Programming

Push is programming language that plays nice with evolutionay computing
/ genetic programming. It is a stack-based language that features 1
stack per data type, including code. Programs are represented by lists
of instructions, which modify the values on the stacks. Instuctions are
executed in order.

More information about PushGP can be found on the
[Push Redux](https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/) and the
[Push Homepage](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html).
